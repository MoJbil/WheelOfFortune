# WheelOfFortune
An updated version of a Wheel of Fortune GUI game created in college

This game was developed to grow my skills in GUI development, plus it was fun. All of the project details can be found in the resources folder. In order to compile, run "javac WheelOfFortune.java" in the src folder, then use "java WheelOfFortune" to run the application.

Future development plans:
-Better input error checks
